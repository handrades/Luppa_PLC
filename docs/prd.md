# Industrial Inventory Multi-App Framework Product Requirements Document (PRD)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Deploy a functional inventory application for cataloging industrial equipment (PLCs, sensors, controllers)
- Establish a reusable multi-app framework foundation for future industrial applications
- Implement ISO-compliant audit trails and comprehensive security measures
- Achieve high-performance targets: <100ms query response times and <2s page loads
- Create a system that supports 300+ PLCs initially with scalability to 10,000+ equipment records
- Build with open-source technologies to maintain zero licensing costs
- Design for air-gapped industrial environments with on-premise deployment
- Enable efficient equipment tracking with site hierarchy and flexible tagging system

### Background Context
This project addresses the critical need for industrial equipment inventory management within manufacturing
environments. Process and controls engineers currently lack a centralized system for tracking PLCs, sensors, and
controllers across multiple sites and production cells. The solution must operate within air-gapped industrial
networks while meeting strict ISO compliance requirements for audit trails and data integrity.

The strategic vision extends beyond a simple inventory system - this project establishes a multi-app framework
foundation that will accelerate development of future industrial applications. By building reusable components
for authentication, monitoring, and UI patterns, subsequent applications can be deployed rapidly while maintaining
consistency and compliance across the platform.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The interface will embody industrial-grade reliability with a clean, minimalist design optimized for process
engineers working in manufacturing environments. The UI prioritizes efficiency and clarity, enabling quick access
to equipment information during plant visits and troubleshooting scenarios. All interactions should feel responsive
and purposeful, with visual feedback that confirms actions in environments where network latency may vary.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Filter-First Navigation**: Advanced filtering capabilities are prominently accessible, allowing engineers to
  quickly narrow down equipment by site, type, or attributes
- **Bulk Operations**: Drag-and-drop or checkbox selection for managing multiple equipment records simultaneously
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for efficient data entry and navigation without mouse dependence
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed contextually to avoid overwhelming new users while
  providing power user capabilities
- **Offline-First Design**: Clear visual indicators for sync status and local changes pending upload

### Core Screens and Views
- Equipment List View (primary interface with filtering, sorting, and search)
- Equipment Detail/Edit Form
- Dashboard Overview (site and equipment type summaries)
- Bulk Import/Export Interface
- User Management & Settings
- Audit Trail Viewer
- Site Hierarchy Navigator

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

### Branding
Industrial-themed Material-UI customization with a professional color palette suitable for extended use in
manufacturing environments. Emphasis on high contrast and readability under varied lighting conditions typical
in industrial settings.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

### Service Architecture
**Monolith with Modular Design** - The project will use a monolithic architecture deployed via Docker containers. While the
infrastructure uses multiple containers (database, cache, monitoring), the application logic remains in a single
deployable unit. This approach balances simplicity for a solo developer with the flexibility to extract services
later if needed.

The monolith will be structured with clear module boundaries using:
- **Workspace Management**: Organized with Nx workspaces, Yarn workspaces, or pnpm workspaces to maintain clear
  separation between modules
- **Module Independence**: Each major feature area (auth, inventory, monitoring) in separate workspace packages with
  explicit dependencies
- **CI/CD Rules**: Automated checks to prevent circular dependencies, enforce module boundaries, and enable independent testing/releasing
- **Interface Contracts**: Well-defined APIs between modules to facilitate future extraction without major refactors
- **Independent Build Artifacts**: Module structure that allows extracting services as separate deployables when needed

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration** - The project requires unit tests for business logic and integration tests for API
endpoints. Focus on critical paths: authentication, CRUD operations, and audit logging. Test coverage target of
70% for core modules. Manual testing convenience methods will be provided for UI workflows. No requirement for
full E2E automation initially due to resource constraints.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Frontend Build**: Vite for fast development builds and optimal production bundles
- **Database Migrations**: TypeORM migration system for schema versioning and rollback capabilities
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with Winston logging to file and console
- **Session Management**: Redis for session storage with 24-hour timeout
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem for uploaded files with virus scanning consideration
- **Deployment**: Docker Swarm for orchestration, supporting single-node initially
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated PostgreSQL dumps to local storage, retained for 30 days
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, Prettier for code consistency; Husky for pre-commit hooks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Application Performance Monitoring (APM) via Prometheus metrics
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js for security headers, CORS configuration for API access
- **Data Validation**: Joi for request validation with detailed error messages
