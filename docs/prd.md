# Industrial Inventory Multi-App Framework Product Requirements Document (PRD)

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Deploy a functional inventory application for cataloging industrial equipment (PLCs, sensors, controllers) that
  serves process and controls engineers
- Establish a reusable multi-app framework foundation that accelerates future industrial application development
- Implement ISO-compliant audit trails and security measures to meet industrial compliance requirements
- Achieve high-performance targets (<100ms query response, <2s page loads) while scaling from 300 to 10,000+ equipment records
- Create cost-efficient solution using open-source technologies suitable for air-gapped industrial environments
- Build with open-source technologies to maintain zero licensing costs
- Design for air-gapped industrial environments with on-premise deployment
- Enable efficient equipment tracking with site hierarchy and flexible tagging system

### Background Context
The industrial equipment management landscape lacks modern, user-friendly solutions tailored for process
engineers working in on-premise, air-gapped environments. Current systems are often outdated, expensive,
or cloud-dependent, making them unsuitable for industrial operations that require reliable offline
capabilities and strict security controls.

This PRD addresses the need for a minimalist, modern CRUD web application that not only solves immediate
inventory management challenges but also establishes a strategic foundation for multiple future industrial
applications. The solution emphasizes ISO compliance, performance optimization, and framework reusability
to maximize long-term value while staying within budget constraints of open-source technologies.

Process and controls engineers currently lack a centralized system for tracking PLCs, sensors, and
controllers across multiple sites and production cells. The solution must operate within air-gapped industrial
networks while meeting strict ISO compliance requirements for audit trails and data integrity.

The strategic vision extends beyond a simple inventory system - this project establishes a multi-app framework
foundation that will accelerate development of future industrial applications. By building reusable components
for authentication, monitoring, and UI patterns, subsequent applications can be deployed rapidly while maintaining
consistency and compliance across the platform.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
**Monorepo** approach using a single repository containing:
- Shared framework components and libraries
- Backend API services
- Frontend React applications
- Infrastructure configuration (Docker, CI/CD)
- Documentation and tooling

This supports the multi-app framework vision while maintaining code sharing and consistent development
workflows.

### Service Architecture
**Layered Monolith with Framework Foundation** - A structured monolithic application with clear separation
of concerns:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Docker Swarm orchestration, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx
- **Framework Layer**: Shared authentication, audit logging, user management, notification services
- **Application Layer**: Inventory application with dedicated schemas and business logic
- **Frontend Layer**: React framework with reusable component library

This approach balances development simplicity for a solo developer while providing the foundation for future
application expansion.

The monolith will be structured with clear module boundaries using:
- **Workspace Management**: Organized with Nx workspaces, Yarn workspaces, or pnpm workspaces to maintain clear
  separation between modules
- **Module Independence**: Each major feature area (auth, inventory, monitoring) in separate workspace packages with
  explicit dependencies
- **CI/CD Rules**: Automated checks to prevent circular dependencies, enforce module boundaries, and enable independent testing/releasing
- **Interface Contracts**: Well-defined APIs between modules to facilitate future extraction without major refactors
- **Independent Build Artifacts**: Module structure that allows extracting services as separate deployables when needed

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing** strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for backend logic and React Testing Library for components
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with supertest, database integration tests
- **Manual Testing Convenience**: Postman collections for API testing and development
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline integration for continuous validation
- Focus on critical paths: authentication, CRUD operations, and audit logging
- Test coverage target of 70% for core modules
- No requirement for full E2E automation initially due to resource constraints

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL primary with Redis for session management and caching
- **Authentication**: Local JWT-based auth with bcrypt password hashing (no external providers)
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with consistent error handling and response formats
- **Frontend Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite for development speed and type safety
- **UI Component Library**: Material-UI with industrial theme customization
- **Container Strategy**: Docker Swarm for on-premise orchestration and service management
- **Monitoring Stack**: Grafana + Prometheus + Winston logging for observability
- **Air-Gap Compatibility**: All dependencies must support offline installation and updates
- **Performance Optimization**: Database indexing strategy, Redis caching, and query optimization
- **Security Framework**: RBAC implementation, input validation with Joi, SQL injection prevention
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with Winston logging to file and console
- **Session Management**: Redis for session storage with 24-hour timeout
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem for uploaded files with virus scanning consideration
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated PostgreSQL dumps to local storage, retained for 30 days
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, Prettier for code consistency; Husky for pre-commit hooks
