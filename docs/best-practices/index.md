# TypeScript Best Practices for Luppa PLC

This document outlines TypeScript best practices specifically tailored for the Luppa PLC multi-app framework project.
These practices ensure code quality, maintainability, and performance for industrial-grade applications.

## Code Quality Checklist

Before committing code, ensure:

- [ ] All functions have explicit return types
- [ ] No `any` types without justification
- [ ] Error cases are handled with Result types
- [ ] Industrial domain terms are used consistently
- [ ] Performance implications considered for 10,000+ records
- [ ] Security validations in place for user inputs
- [ ] Audit logging implemented for data changes
- [ ] Tests written for critical business logic
- [ ] Documentation updated for public APIs
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier rules followed

## Tools Integration

This document aligns with our existing toolchain:

- **ESLint Configuration**: Rules in `config/.eslintrc.cjs`
- **TypeScript**: Strict configuration in `config/tsconfig.json`
- **Testing**: Jest + RTL patterns as established
- **Validation**: Zod schemas complement Joi validation
- **Logging**: Winston integration for audit trails
