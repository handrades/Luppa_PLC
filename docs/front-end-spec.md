2. **Subtle & Professional:** Enhance usability without drawing attention to the animation itself
3. **Performance Conscious:** Smooth 60fps animations that don't impact data processing
4. **Consistent Timing:** Standardized durations and easing for predictable user experience
5. **Accessible Motion:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for users sensitive to animation

### Key Animations

**Core Equipment Management Animations:**

- **Equipment Row Hover:** Subtle background color transition with slight elevation (Duration: 150ms, Easing: power2.out)
- **Form Field Focus:** Border color change with gentle glow effect (Duration: 200ms, Easing: power2.out)
- **Auto-save Confirmation:** Success checkmark with gentle scale animation (Duration: 400ms, Easing: back.out)
- **Data Loading:** Professional skeleton animation with shimmer effect (Duration: 1.5s loop, Easing: linear)
- **Filter Panel Slide:** Smooth slide-in/out with backdrop fade (Duration: 300ms, Easing: power2.inOut)
- **Status Indicator Pulse:** Subtle breathing animation for online/offline states (Duration: 2s loop, Easing: sine.inOut)
- **Search Results Appearance:** Staggered fade-in of results with slight upward motion (Duration: 250ms, Easing: power2.out)
- **Theme Toggle:** Smooth color transitions across entire interface (Duration: 400ms, Easing: power2.inOut)
- **Bulk Selection:** Checkbox states with satisfying check animation (Duration: 200ms, Easing: back.out)
- **Error State:** Gentle shake animation for invalid input feedback (Duration: 300ms, Easing: elastic.out)
- **Modal Open/Close:** Scale and fade transition with backdrop blur (Duration: 300ms, Easing: power2.out)
- **Chart Data Updates:** Smooth interpolation between data states (Duration: 500ms, Easing: power2.inOut)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial application load <2 seconds, subsequent navigation <500ms
- **Interaction Response:** User interactions (clicks, typing) respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all GSAP animations, even with large datasets
- **Data Operations:** Equipment search/filtering <100ms for datasets up to 10,000 records
- **Memory Usage:** Total application memory footprint <2GB as specified in requirements

### Design Strategies

**Performance-First Design Decisions:**

1. **Virtual Scrolling Architecture:** Only render visible rows + buffer for large datasets, GSAP animations only on visible elements

2. **Progressive Data Loading:** Essential equipment data on initial load, detailed information on-demand, background preloading of likely-needed data

3. **Intelligent Caching Strategy:** Component-level caching with React.memo, API response caching, lazy loading for images, search result caching

4. **Optimized Animation Performance:** GPU acceleration with force3D, batch DOM reads/writes, cleanup of animations and event listeners

5. **Bundle Optimization:** Route-based code splitting, tree shaking unused components, dynamic imports for GSAP plugins, asset optimization

6. **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of GSAP animations, efficient data structures, minimal object creation in render loops, optimized image disposal

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Stakeholder Review & Validation** - Present specification to engineering stakeholders, validate
   with actual process engineers, confirm technical approach alignment

2. **Component Library Foundation Setup** - Initialize React project with Vite/TypeScript/Material-UI,
   set up Storybook, configure GSAP integration, implement industrial theme system

3. **Priority Component Development** - Start with DataGrid (equipment listing), build EquipmentForm
   (CRUD functionality), create AppLayout/Navigation (framework foundation), develop StatusCard (dashboard
   functionality)

4. **Performance Testing Infrastructure** - Set up testing with 10,000+ records, implement virtual
   scrolling validation, configure accessibility testing automation, establish animation performance
   monitoring
