### Repository Structure

[Source: architecture.md#repository-structure]
**Package Organization:**

- `/apps` - Application packages (web, api)
- `/packages` - Shared libraries (ui, shared-types, config)
- `/infrastructure` - Docker configs and deployment scripts

### Development Environment Setup Requirements

[Source: architecture.md#development-workflow-testing-strategy]
The setup script requirements include:

- Node.js version verification (>=20.0.0)
- pnpm installation and verification (>=9.0.0)
- Workspace package linking preferences

### Pre-Implementation Status

✅ **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION** - Story meets quality standards and provides solid technical foundation. Ready for developer assignment once Story 0.1 is confirmed complete.

### Mentoring Notes for Story Authors

This story demonstrates excellent practices:

- Clear technical requirements with architectural context
- Proper dependency identification and sequencing
- Comprehensive middleware and security considerations
- Production-ready patterns (graceful shutdown, logging, error handling)

Consider adding specific examples for environment variables and error response formats in future backend stories.
