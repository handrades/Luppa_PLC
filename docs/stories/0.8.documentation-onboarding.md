# Story 0.8: Documentation & Onboarding - Brownfield Addition

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Complete monorepo structure, Backend/Frontend apps, Development tooling, CI/CD pipeline
- Technology: Node.js, pnpm, TypeScript, React, Material-UI, Docker, PostgreSQL
- Follows pattern: Epic 0 project initialization foundation pattern
- Touch points: All project documentation, API endpoints, React components, development workflow

## User Story

As a new developer,
I want comprehensive documentation and quick start guides,
So that I can begin contributing within 30 minutes.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Create SETUP.md with prerequisites, quick start, and detailed instructions
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md with code style, branching, and PR guidelines
3. Create ARCHITECTURE.md with system overview and key decisions
4. Set up OpenAPI specification with Swagger UI for development
5. Create Storybook stories for base components with documentation
6. Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs and complex logic
7. Create initial ADRs for key architectural decisions
8. Configure automated documentation generation and deployment

**Integration Requirements:**

1. Existing project structure and development workflow continues to work unchanged
2. New documentation follows existing markdown linting rules and project patterns
3. Integration with CI/CD pipeline maintains current build behavior
4. Documentation generation integrates with existing development scripts

**Quality Requirements:**

1. All documentation is covered by markdown linting and quality checks
2. Setup documentation is tested with fresh environment setup
3. No regression in existing development workflow verified
4. All documentation files follow established project patterns

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extends existing project foundation with comprehensive onboarding documentation
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows Epic 0 project initialization approach with focus on developer experience
- **Key Constraints:** Must work in air-gapped environments, align with existing tooling and workflows

## Definition of Done

- [x] SETUP.md provides clear prerequisites and quick start instructions

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Documentation setup conflicts with existing development workflow
**Mitigation:** Incremental setup with validation of existing patterns and tooling
**Rollback:** Remove documentation tooling packages and restore original configurations

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [x] Story can be completed in one development session
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward
- [x] Follows existing patterns exactly
- [x] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**

- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous
- [x] Integration points are clearly specified
- [x] Success criteria are testable
- [x] Rollback approach is simple

## Compatibility Verification

- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Documentation generation is additive only
- [x] New documentation follows existing design patterns
- [x] Performance impact is negligible
