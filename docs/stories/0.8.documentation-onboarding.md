## Status

Ready for Review

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Complete monorepo structure, Backend/Frontend apps, Development tooling, CI/CD pipeline
- Technology: Node.js, pnpm, TypeScript, React, Material-UI, Docker, PostgreSQL
- Follows pattern: Epic 0 project initialization foundation pattern
- Touch points: All project documentation, API endpoints, React components, development workflow

## User Story

As a new developer,
I want comprehensive documentation and quick start guides,
So that I can begin contributing within 30 minutes.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Create SETUP.md with prerequisites, quick start, and detailed instructions
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md with code style, branching, and PR guidelines
3. Create ARCHITECTURE.md with system overview and key decisions
4. Set up OpenAPI specification with Swagger UI for development
5. Create Storybook stories for base components with documentation
6. Add JSDoc comments for all public APIs and complex logic
7. Create initial ADRs for key architectural decisions
8. Configure automated documentation generation and deployment

**Integration Requirements:**

1. Existing project structure and development workflow continues to work unchanged
2. New documentation follows existing markdown linting rules and project patterns
3. Integration with CI/CD pipeline maintains current build behavior
