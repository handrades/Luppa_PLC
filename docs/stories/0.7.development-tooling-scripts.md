# Story 0.7: Development Tooling & Scripts - Project Foundation

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Monorepo structure, Backend/Frontend apps, CI/CD pipeline
- Technology: Node.js, pnpm, TypeScript, Git, VS Code
- Follows pattern: Project initialization foundation pattern
- Touch points: All workspace packages, Git workflow, IDE configuration

## User Story

As a developer,
I want comprehensive development tools and scripts configured,
So that I can maintain code quality and productivity throughout the development lifecycle.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Configure Git hooks with Husky for pre-commit, commit-msg, and pre-push validation
2. Set up lint-staged for incremental linting on staged files only
3. Configure Jest testing framework with coverage thresholds and workspace support
4. Create utility scripts: setup.ps1, reset-db.ps1, generate-types.ps1 for common development tasks
5. Configure VS Code workspace settings and recommended extensions list
6. Create troubleshooting guide for common development and setup issues
7. Set up conventional commits with commitizen for standardized commit messages
8. Add Plop.js templates for component and API endpoint generation

**Integration Requirements:**

1. Existing monorepo structure and package scripts continue to work unchanged
2. New tooling follows existing pnpm workspace pattern
3. Integration with CI/CD pipeline maintains current build behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

1. All tooling is covered by appropriate configuration and documentation
2. Setup documentation is updated with new tooling requirements
3. No regression in existing development workflow verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extends existing monorepo with development productivity tools
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follows Epic 0 project initialization foundation approach
- **Key Constraints:** Must work in air-gapped environments, PowerShell preference over bash
