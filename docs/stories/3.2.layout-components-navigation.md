## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.1 implementation:

- Material-UI v6.5.0 is being used (downgraded from v7 for Grid compatibility)
- Theme system with light/dark mode is fully implemented and tested
- ThemeContext and ThemeToggle components are available for use
- 8px spacing system and custom breakpoints are configured [Source: Story 3.1 Completion Notes]

### Existing Component Infrastructure

Current layout components in `apps/web/src/components/common/Layout/`:

- **AppLayout.tsx**: Basic layout structure with header and sidebar integration
- **Header.tsx**: MUI AppBar with menu trigger, theme toggle, and user avatar
- **Sidebar.tsx**: Temporary drawer with static navigation items
- **ThemeToggle.tsx**: Theme switching component (completed in Story 3.1)
  [Source: Existing codebase analysis]

### Component Organization Pattern

Components must follow this structure [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]:

```typescript
apps/web/src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/
│   │   ├── Layout/          # Layout components location
│   │   ├── DataDisplay/
│   │   ├── Forms/
│   │   └── Feedback/
├── stores/                  # Zustand stores location
├── hooks/                   # Custom hooks location
└── pages/
```

### State Management Requirements

Zustand store structure for authentication [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State Structure]:

```typescript
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  token: string | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  login: (credentials: LoginCredentials) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  refreshToken: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### User Model for Header Display

User data structure available from auth service [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User]:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string; // Display in header
  lastName: string; // Display in header
  roleId: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  lastLogin: Date | null;
}
```

### Existing Auth Service Integration

Authentication service already implemented at `apps/web/src/services/authService.ts`:

- `getCurrentUser()`: Returns current user data from localStorage
- `isAuthenticated()`: Checks if user is logged in
- `hasRole(role)`: Validates user role
- `logout()`: Clears authentication data
  [Source: Existing authService.ts implementation]

### Material-UI Breakpoint System

Configured breakpoints from Story 3.1 [Source: apps/web/src/styles/theme.ts]:

- xs: 0px (mobile)
- sm: 600px (tablet portrait)
- md: 960px (tablet landscape)
- lg: 1280px (desktop)
- xl: 1920px (large desktop)

### Navigation Patterns

Current static navigation structure in Sidebar.tsx:

```typescript
const navigationItems = [
  { label: 'Dashboard', path: '/', icon: DashboardIcon },
  { label: 'Equipment', path: '/equipment', icon: ComputerIcon },
  { label: 'Settings', path: '/settings', icon: SettingsIcon },
];
```

[Source: apps/web/src/components/common/Layout/Sidebar.tsx]

### React Router Integration

- React Router v6 is configured in the project
- Routes defined in `apps/web/src/App.tsx`
- Use `useLocation` hook for active route detection
- Use `useNavigate` hook for programmatic navigation
  [Source: Existing App.tsx routing setup]

### File Locations for New Components

- Breadcrumbs: `apps/web/src/components/common/Layout/Breadcrumbs.tsx`
- Auth Store: `apps/web/src/stores/authStore.ts`
- useAuth Hook: `apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- Loading Skeletons: `apps/web/src/components/common/Feedback/LoadingSkeleton.tsx`

### Testing Requirements

No specific testing standards found in architecture docs. Based on existing test patterns:

- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Test files co-located with components (e.g., `Component.test.tsx`)
- Jest as test runner (configured in Story 3.1)
- Coverage for user interactions and responsive behavior
- Test data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
  [Source: Existing test file patterns]

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- **Test file location**: Co-located with components (e.g., `AppLayout.test.tsx` next to `AppLayout.tsx`)
- **Testing framework**: Jest + React Testing Library (already configured)
- **Component testing patterns**:
  - Test user interactions (clicks, navigation)
  - Test responsive behavior at different breakpoints
  - Test loading states and transitions
  - Test authentication state changes
- **Coverage requirements**: All new components must have corresponding test files
- **Accessibility testing**: Validate ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-13

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

This is an exemplary implementation of a comprehensive theme system for an industrial React application.
The code demonstrates senior-level architecture with proper separation of concerns, robust TypeScript typing, and excellent testing coverage.

**Strengths:**

- Excellent component architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Strong TypeScript usage throughout (with minor exceptions now fixed)
- Comprehensive test coverage (31 tests, all passing)
- Good accessibility implementation with ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Responsive design well-implemented with Material-UI breakpoints
- Smart use of React hooks and performance optimizations

**Areas that needed improvement (now addressed):**

- Header component had performance and UX issues
- Type safety concerns in auth service
- Missing scroll event throttling

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/common/Layout/Header.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks for performance optimization
  - **Why**: Functions and computed values were being recreated on every render
  - **How**: Memoization prevents unnecessary re-renders and improves performance
- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/common/Layout/Header.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added role display name mapping
  - **Why**: Raw roleId (e.g., "admin") was shown instead of user-friendly names
  - **How**: Created roleDisplayNames mapping for better UX
- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/common/Layout/Header.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed useEffect dependency array
  - **Why**: Empty dependency array with loadUser() could cause stale closures
  - **How**: Added proper dependency to ensure correct behavior

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/common/Layout/AppLayout.tsx`
  - **Change**: Improved containerProps typing from `object` to `Partial<ComponentProps<typeof Container>>`
  - **Why**: Better type safety and IDE autocomplete
  - **How**: Using ComponentProps utility type from React

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/services/authService.ts`
  - **Change**: Removed `any` type from user property, exported User interface
  - **Why**: Critical security concern - untyped data could lead to vulnerabilities
  - **How**: Properly typed User interface and exported for reuse

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/stores/authStore.ts`
  - **Change**: Import User type from authService instead of duplicating
  - **Why**: DRY principle - avoid type duplication
  - **How**: Import shared type definition

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/hooks/useScrollRestoration.ts`
  - **Change**: Added throttling to scroll event handler
  - **Why**: Performance optimization - scroll events fire frequently
  - **How**: Implemented throttle function with 100ms delay

- **File**: `/apps/web/src/components/common/Layout/Header.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Updated test to expect "Administrator" instead of "admin"
  - **Why**: Test was failing after role display name improvement
  - **How**: Updated assertion to match new behavior
