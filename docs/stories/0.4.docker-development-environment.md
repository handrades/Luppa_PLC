## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Stories 0.1-0.3, the project foundation has been established with:

- **Monorepo Structure**: pnpm workspace with apps/api and apps/web configured
- **Backend Service**: Express application running on configurable port (default 3010) with health endpoint
- **Frontend Service**: React/Vite application with development server on port 5173
- **Environment Configuration**: Both services use environment variables for configuration
- **Build Systems**: TypeScript compilation and Vite bundling properly configured

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **IaC Tool**: Docker Compose 2.32 - Latest with improved performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL ^16.0 (target: 17.x when released)
- **Cache**: Redis ^7.2.0 (target: 8.x when released)
- **Backend Framework**: Express ^4.19.0 running in Node.js container
- **Frontend Build**: Vite 6.0 with static file serving

### Docker Service Configuration

[Source: Epic 0.4 requirements]

**Required Services:**

- **api**: Backend Express application container
- **web**: Frontend static files served via Nginx or development server
- **postgres**: PostgreSQL database with persistent storage
- **redis**: Redis cache with persistence configuration
- **nginx**: Reverse proxy for routing and load balancing

### Database Configuration Requirements

**PostgreSQL Setup:**

- Use official PostgreSQL 17 image when available (currently use 16)
- Initialize with database creation scripts
- Configure connection pooling for application access
- Set up persistent volumes for data retention
- Configure proper authentication and security

### Redis Configuration Requirements

**Redis Setup:**

- Use official Redis 8 image when available (currently use 7.2)
- Configure AOF (Append Only File) persistence
- Set memory limits appropriate for development environment
- Configure eviction policies for cache management
- Set up access authentication if required

### Nginx Proxy Configuration

**Reverse Proxy Setup:**

- Route /api/\* requests to backend service (port 3010)
- Route /\* requests to frontend service (port 5173 or static files)
- Configure appropriate headers for CORS and caching
- Set up proper error pages and logging
- Configure gzip compression for static assets

### Docker Networking

**Network Architecture:**

- Create custom bridge network for service isolation
- Configure service discovery using container names
- Set up proper port mapping for external access
- Ensure secure inter-service communication
- Configure network aliases for service resolution

### Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables:**

- Database connection parameters (host, port, user, password, database)
- Redis connection parameters (host, port, password if used)
- API service configuration (port, environment, log level)
- Frontend service configuration (API URL, environment)
- Docker service configuration (image tags, resource limits)

### File Locations and Structure

Based on project structure, files should be created at:

- Docker configuration: `docker-compose.dev.yml` in project root
- Nginx configuration: `infrastructure/docker/nginx.conf`
- Environment template: `.env.example` in project root
- PowerShell tasks: `psakefile.ps1` with Docker management tasks
- Database scripts: `infrastructure/docker/postgres/init.sql`

### Development Workflow Integration

**PowerShell (psake) Commands:**

- `Invoke-psake up`: Start all development services
- `Invoke-psake down`: Stop and remove all containers
- `Invoke-psake logs`: View logs from all services
- `Invoke-psake shell-api`: Access backend container shell
- `Invoke-psake reset-db`: Reset database to initial state

### Health Check Configuration

**Service Health Checks:**

- **API**: GET /health endpoint with 30-second intervals
- **PostgreSQL**: pg_isready command with appropriate timeouts
- **Redis**: redis-cli ping command with connection verification
- **Nginx**: HTTP request to proxy endpoints
- **Frontend**: File system check or HTTP request to dev server

### Performance Considerations

**Resource Optimization:**

- Configure appropriate memory limits for each service
- Set up efficient volume mounting for development
- Configure proper restart policies for service reliability
- Optimize image sizes and startup times
- Configure proper logging and log rotation

## Testing
