## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 3.3 (DataGrid Component):

- Successfully used Material-UI components with industrial theming
- @mui/x-date-pickers already installed for date picker functionality
- Testing pattern established using Jest + React Testing Library
- Component organization in apps/web/src/components/common/ directory
- Accessibility patterns implemented with ARIA attributes
- Used react-hook-form pattern in PLCForm example

### Tech Stack References

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **UI Component Library**: Material-UI (MUI) 7.0.0 - Pre-built industrial UI components
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + RTL 30.0 / 16.1 - Component and unit testing
- **State Management**: Zustand 5.0.2 - Client state management

### Component Architecture

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]

Form components should be placed in:

```text
apps/web/src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/
│   │   ├── Forms/
│   │   │   ├── FormField.tsx
│   │   │   ├── SelectField.tsx
│   │   │   └── ValidationError.tsx
```

### Form Component Template Pattern

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]

The PLCForm example shows the established pattern for forms:

- Use react-hook-form with zodResolver for validation
- Material-UI components (TextField, Select, FormControl, FormHelperText)
- Controller wrapper for form field integration
- Proper error display with FormHelperText
- Grid layout for responsive design
- useMutation from @tanstack/react-query for API calls
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback

Key imports and patterns:

```typescript
import { useForm, Controller } from 'react-hook-form';
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { TextField, Select, MenuItem, FormControl, FormHelperText } from '@mui/material';
```

### Validation Schema Pattern

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]

Use zod for schema validation:

```typescript
const schema = z.object({
  field: z.string().min(1, 'Field is required'),
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email'),
  number: z.number().min(0, 'Must be positive'),
});
```

### Hook Organization

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]

Custom hooks should be placed in:

```text
apps/web/src/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useAutoSave.ts
│   ├── useFormDirtyState.ts
│   └── useToast.ts (already exists)
```

### State Management Pattern

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]

Forms can use Zustand for cross-component state if needed:

- Local form state with react-hook-form
- Global UI state (loading, errors) with Zustand
- Persist form drafts to localStorage using Zustand persist middleware

### Material-UI Theme Configuration

The project has industrial theming configured in apps/web/src/styles/theme.ts

- High contrast colors for manufacturing environments
- Custom breakpoints for responsive design
- Dark mode support already implemented

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

Testing requirements:

- Test files co-located with components (e.g., FormField.test.tsx)
- Use @testing-library/react for component testing
- Test accessibility with aria queries
- Mock API calls and external dependencies
- Aim for behavior testing over implementation details

### Dependencies Already Available

From package.json analysis and previous stories:

- @mui/material (Material-UI components)
- @mui/x-date-pickers (Date picker component)
- react-hook-form (Form state management)
- @hookform/resolvers (Validation resolvers)
- zod (Schema validation)
- @testing-library/react (Testing)
- date-fns (Date utilities)

### Related Components from Previous Stories

Components that forms will integrate with:

- Toast.tsx (apps/web/src/components/common/Feedback/) - For notifications
- LoadingSpinner.tsx - For save indicators
- AppLayout.tsx - For navigation blocking integration

### Code Quality Assessment

#### ✅ Strengths

1. **Excellent Component Architecture**
   - Clean separation of concerns with FormField wrapper pattern
   - Consistent styling approach across all form components
   - Proper TypeScript typing with appropriate use of generics and interfaces
   - Excellent Material-UI integration patterns following MUI best practices

2. **Accessibility Implementation (Outstanding)**
   - All ARIA attributes properly implemented (aria-label, aria-required, aria-invalid, aria-describedby)
   - Proper focus management with keyboard navigation
   - Touch-friendly 48px minimum target sizes throughout
   - Screen reader friendly with proper semantic HTML

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Auto-save with robust debouncing and comprehensive error handling
   - Form dirty state management with both browser and React Router navigation blocking
   - Multi-step form with smooth animations and persistent state
   - Flexible validation error handling supporting strings, arrays, and objects

4. **Code Quality**
   - Clean, readable code with JSDoc documentation
   - Consistent naming conventions following React patterns
   - Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Excellent use of React hooks, memoization, and refs

#### ⚠️ Minor Issues Found

1. **TypeScript Improvements (Low Priority)**
   - DatePicker has minor type issues with MUI Date adapter (8 TS errors remaining)
   - StepIndicator has a prop type mismatch with StepButton
   - Test files have some type assertions that could be improved

2. **ESLint Warnings (2 warnings, 0 errors)**
   - Minor warnings about unused disable directives
   - All critical linting passes successfully

3. **Code Refinements**
   - `useAutoSave` uses Record<string, unknown> which is appropriate but could be made generic for better type safety
   - Missing error boundaries for form components (defensive programming)

### Feature Implementation Review

#### ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Met Excellently

1. **AC1: Consistent Styling** - Beautiful Material-UI components with industrial theme ✅
2. **AC2: Inline Validation** - ValidationError component handles all error types ✅

#### Medium Priority

1. **Add Storybook stories** - Document component usage and variations
2. **Implement form field focus management utilities** - Helper hooks for complex forms
3. **Add integration tests** - Test form components working together

#### Low Priority

1. **Extract validation patterns** - Create reusable validation schemas
2. **Performance monitoring** - Add metrics for form interactions
3. **Consider using React Hook Form Controller** - For even better form integration

### Overall Assessment
