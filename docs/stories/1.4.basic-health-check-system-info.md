### Testing Requirements

**Test File Location**: `/apps/api/src/__tests__/health/`
**Testing Framework**: Jest with Supertest for API endpoint testing
**Test Categories**:

- Health endpoint integration tests with all services healthy
- Database connection failure simulation and error handling
- Redis connection failure simulation and error handling
- Response time validation (under 100ms requirement)
- JSON response structure validation for monitoring tools
- HTTP status code validation for different scenarios

**Specific Requirements**: All health check functionality must have comprehensive test coverage including:

- All services operational scenario returning 200 OK
- Database failure scenario returning 503 Service Unavailable
- Redis failure scenario returning 503 Service Unavailable
- Response time consistently under 100ms
- Structured JSON format validation
- Error details in response for troubleshooting

[Source: Existing test patterns and docs/prd.md NFR requirements]

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements**:

- Response time must be consistently under 100ms (NFR1)
- Health check should not impact application performance
- Use efficient connection pool status queries

**Monitoring Integration**:

- JSON response format must be parseable by monitoring systems
- HTTP status codes must follow standard conventions (200 OK, 503 Service Unavailable)
- Response structure should be consistent for automated monitoring

**Error Handling**:

- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Detailed error information without exposing sensitive data
- Appropriate HTTP status codes for different failure scenarios

**Environment Variables**:

- Use existing database and Redis configuration
- Support for deployment timestamp via environment or build process
- Version information from package.json

[Source: docs/prd.md NFR requirements and existing architecture patterns]

### Testing

#### Test Standards and Framework

**Test file locations**: `/apps/api/src/__tests__/health/` directory for health endpoint testing
**Testing frameworks**: Jest for unit testing, Supertest for API endpoint testing, database/Redis mocking for service testing
**Test patterns**: Integration testing, service failure simulation, performance validation, response structure validation
**Specific requirements**: All health check enhancements must have comprehensive test coverage validating performance requirements, error handling, and integration with existing services
