# Story 4.2: Equipment CRUD API

## Status

Done

## Story

**As an** API developer,
**I want** RESTful endpoints for equipment management,
**so that** the frontend can perform all necessary operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1: POST /api/v1/equipment creates new equipment with validation
2: GET /api/v1/equipment lists all equipment with pagination (default 50 per page)
3: GET /api/v1/equipment/:id returns single equipment record with full details
4: PUT /api/v1/equipment/:id updates equipment with optimistic locking
5: DELETE /api/v1/equipment/:id soft deletes equipment, preserving audit trail
6: All endpoints validate user permissions based on role
7: Joi schemas validate all input fields with appropriate rules
8: API returns consistent error format with field-level validation errors

## Current Implementation Assessment

### ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

This story has been fully implemented with a complete API layer for equipment management. The database schema from Story 4.1 provides the foundation.

**Analysis of Required Components:**

- **Equipment Repository**: Pagination, filtering, search functionality
- **Equipment Service**: Business logic layer with CRUD operations
- **Validation Schemas**: Joi schemas for all equipment fields and operations
- **Equipment Routes**: REST endpoints with authentication/authorization
- **Audit Integration**: Automatic audit logging for all operations
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error format with field-level validation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create EquipmentRepository with search and pagination functionality (AC 2)
- [x] Create EquipmentService with CRUD operations and audit integration (ACs 1, 3-5)
- [x] Create equipmentSchemas.ts with comprehensive Joi validation (AC 7)
- [x] Create equipment.ts routes with all 5 REST endpoints (ACs 1-5)
- [x] Implement authentication and authorization middleware (AC 6)
- [x] Add consistent error handling with field-level validation (AC 8)
- [x] Update main router to include equipment routes
- [x] Create comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [x] Verify audit logging works correctly for all operations
- [x] Test optimistic locking implementation for updates

## Technical Design Notes

### Database Schema Integration

**From Story 4.1:** The database implements a sophisticated multi-table hierarchy:

- **Equipment Table**: Core equipment records with foreign keys to Cell and User entities
- **PLC Table**: Extends equipment with PLC-specific fields (tag_id, make, model, ip_address)
- **Relationships**: Equipment → Cell → Site hierarchy with proper foreign key constraints
- **Audit Integration**: All tables have audit triggers for automatic change tracking

### API Design Decisions

**Equipment Model for API:**

The API will present a flattened equipment view that combines:

- Equipment entity data (id, name, equipment_type, cell_id)
- Associated PLC data (tag_id, description, make, model, ip_address, firmware_version)
- Site hierarchy data (site name, cell type, cell id)
- Audit metadata (created_by, updated_by, created_at, updated_at)

**Endpoint Design:**

- `POST /api/v1/equipment` - Creates equipment + PLC record in transaction
- `GET /api/v1/equipment` - Returns flattened equipment list with site hierarchy
- `GET /api/v1/equipment/:id` - Returns single equipment with full details and relationships
- `PUT /api/v1/equipment/:id` - Updates equipment and PLC data with optimistic locking
- `DELETE /api/v1/equipment/:id` - Soft delete with `deleted_at` timestamp

### Validation Requirements

**Core Field Validation:**

- **name**: Required, 1-100 characters, alphanumeric with spaces/hyphens
- **equipment_type**: Required, must be valid EquipmentType enum value
- **tag_id**: Required, unique, 1-100 characters, alphanumeric
- **description**: Required, text field, 1-1000 characters
- **make**: Required, 1-100 characters
- **model**: Required, 1-100 characters
- **ip_address**: Optional, valid INET format, unique constraint when not null
- **firmware_version**: Optional, 1-50 characters
- **cell_id**: Required, valid UUID, must exist in cells table

### Permission Requirements

**Role-Based Access Control:**

- **Admin**: Full CRUD access to all equipment
- **Engineer**: Create, read, update equipment
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to equipment

**Permission Mappings:**

- `equipment.create` - POST operations
- `equipment.read` - GET operations
- `equipment.update` - PUT operations
- `equipment.delete` - DELETE operations

### Error Handling Strategy

**Consistent Error Format:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed",
    "details": {
      "field_name": "Specific field error message"
    }
  }
}
```

**Error Types:**

- **400 Bad Request**: Validation errors, malformed data
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid authentication
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Equipment not found
- **409 Conflict**: IP address already in use, optimistic locking conflict
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server errors

### Optimistic Locking Implementation

**Version-Based Locking:**

- Use `updated_at` timestamp for optimistic locking
- Client must provide current `updated_at` value in PUT requests
- Server compares timestamps before updating
- Return 409 Conflict if timestamps don't match

### Pagination Strategy

**Default Pagination:**

- Page size: 50 records (configurable via query parameter)
- Maximum page size: 100 records
- Response includes pagination metadata

**Pagination Response:**

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 50,
    "totalItems": 150,
    "totalPages": 3
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**

- EquipmentService methods with mock dependencies
- Validation schema edge cases
- Error handling scenarios

**Integration Tests:**

- Full API endpoint testing with database
