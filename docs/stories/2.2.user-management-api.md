## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1 (Audit Logging Service):

- Complete audit logging system is operational with comprehensive tracking
- Database triggers automatically capture all user table modifications
- Audit middleware provides session context (user ID, IP, user agent) for all requests
- AuditService provides compliance reporting and risk assessment capabilities
- Authentication middleware is established and provides req.user context
- TypeORM entities and repositories follow established patterns

### Data Models

**User Entity**: Core authentication entity already defined in database schema

- id: UUID - Unique identifier using gen_random_uuid()
- email: string - Unique email for authentication (indexed for performance)
- password_hash: string - bcrypt hashed password (never returned in API responses)
- first_name: string - User's first name (required, max 100 characters)
- last_name: string - User's last name (required, max 100 characters)
- role_id: UUID - Foreign key to roles table (nullable with ON DELETE SET NULL)
- is_active: boolean - Account status flag (defaults to true)
- last_login: timestamp - Track user activity (nullable)
- created_at: timestamp - Account creation time (auto-generated)
- updated_at: timestamp - Last modification time (auto-updated via trigger)

**Role Entity**: Permission management system already defined

- id: UUID - Unique identifier
- name: string - Role name (Admin, Engineer, Viewer)
- permissions: JSONB - Granular permission configuration
- description: string - Role purpose description
- is_system: boolean - Protected system role flag
- created_at/updated_at: timestamps

**User-Role Relationships**:

- User belongs to one Role (many-to-one relationship)
- Role foreign key constraint: ON DELETE SET NULL preserves user records
