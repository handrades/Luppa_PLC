## Dev Notes

### Database Configuration Details

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**PostgreSQL Full-Text Search Setup**:

- PostgreSQL 17.5 provides native full-text search with advanced ranking capabilities
- Target tables for search: `plcs`, `equipment`, `cells`, `sites`, `tags` with existing view `v_plc_hierarchy`
- Use `to_tsvector('english', field_content)` for text vectorization with language-specific stemming
- GIN index creation pattern: `CREATE INDEX idx_plcs_search ON plcs USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', description || ' ' || make || ' ' || model))`
- Existing view `v_plc_hierarchy` already provides necessary table joins for hierarchical search
- Database supports INET data types for IP address search integration

**Search Vector Configuration**:

```sql
-- Weighted search vector combining multiple fields
ALTER TABLE plcs ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;
CREATE INDEX idx_plcs_search_vector ON plcs USING GIN(search_vector);

-- Update trigger for maintaining search vector
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_plc_search_vector()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.search_vector :=
        setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.description, '')), 'A') ||
        setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.make, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(NEW.model, '')), 'B') ||
        setweight(to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(NEW.tag_id, '')), 'C');
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**Search Endpoint Design**:

- Enhance existing `/plcs` endpoint patterns for search functionality
- RESTful endpoint: `GET /api/v1/search/equipment?q={query}&page={page}&pageSize={pageSize}&fields={fields}`
- Response format follows existing `PaginatedResponse` structure from other endpoints
- Include hierarchy information using existing join patterns from v_plc_hierarchy view
- Support additional parameters: `sortBy`, `sortOrder`, `includeHighlights`, `maxResults`

**Search Response Structure**:

```typescript
interface SearchResponse {
  data: SearchResultItem[];
  pagination: PaginationInfo;
  searchMetadata: {
    query: string;
    executionTimeMs: number;
    totalMatches: number;
    suggestedCorrections?: string[];
  };
}

interface SearchResultItem extends PLC {
  relevanceScore: number;
  highlightedFields: {
    description?: string;
    make?: string;
    model?: string;
    tags?: string[];
  };
  hierarchyPath: string; // "Site > Cell > Equipment > PLC"
}
```

### Frontend Architecture Requirements

[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Component Structure**:

- Search components location: `/apps/web/src/components/search/`
- Follow existing patterns from DataGrid component (Story 3.3) for consistent UX
- Service layer: `/apps/web/src/services/search.service.ts` using axios client patterns
- State management: `/apps/web/src/stores/search.store.ts` following Zustand 5.0.2 conventions
- Use Material-UI 7.0.0 components for visual consistency with existing industrial theme

**State Management Pattern**:

```typescript
interface SearchStore {
  // Search state
  query: string;
  results: SearchResultItem[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;

  // History and suggestions
  recentSearches: RecentSearch[];
  suggestions: string[];

  // Performance tracking
  lastSearchTime: number;
  searchMetrics: SearchMetrics;

  // Actions
  setQuery: (query: string) => void;
  executeSearch: (query: string) => Promise<void>;
  clearResults: () => void;
  addToHistory: (query: string) => void;
}
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Database Performance**:

- Target: <100ms response time for searches across 10,000+ PLC records
- Implement materialized view refresh strategy for search index maintenance
- Use Redis caching with intelligent cache invalidation based on data changes
- Configure PostgreSQL `work_mem` and `shared_buffers` for optimal full-text search performance

**Frontend Performance**:

- Virtual scrolling threshold: 100 search results before virtualization
- Debounce delay: 300ms for search input to balance responsiveness and API calls
- Memoization strategy for expensive highlighting and formatting operations
- Progressive loading with skeleton UI components during search execution

### Testing Standards and Requirements

**Backend Testing Requirements**:

- Minimum 90% code coverage for SearchService module
- Performance benchmarks must consistently achieve <100ms for 10,000 record searches
