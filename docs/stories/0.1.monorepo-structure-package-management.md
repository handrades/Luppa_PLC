# Story 0.1: Monorepo Structure & Package Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly structured monorepo with package management configured,
**so that** I can organize code modules and share dependencies efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Initialize pnpm workspace with pnpm-workspace.yaml defining apps/*, packages/* locations
2. Create folder structure: /apps (web, api), /packages (shared-types, ui-components, config), /infrastructure (docker, scripts)
3. Configure root package.json with workspace scripts: dev, build, test, lint
4. Set up TypeScript with base tsconfig.json and package-specific configurations
5. Create comprehensive .gitignore covering node_modules, dist, .env, and IDE files
6. Add .nvmrc specifying Node.js v20.x LTS version
7. Create README.md with project overview and quick start instructions
8. Configure ESLint and Prettier with workspace-wide rules and .editorconfig

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in Epic 0, so no previous story context exists. This story establishes the foundation for all subsequent development work.

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Monorepo Tool**: pnpm workspaces (better performance and disk efficiency than npm/yarn)
- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3 - Type-safe development across frontend and backend
- **Node.js**: v20.x LTS as specified in engine requirements
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.0 for frontend bundling
- **Testing**: Jest 30.0 for unit testing across packages

### Repository Structure
[Source: architecture.md#repository-structure]
**Package Organization:**
- `/apps` - Application packages (web, api)
- `/packages` - Shared libraries (ui, shared-types, config)
- `/infrastructure` - Docker configs and deployment scripts

### Development Environment Setup Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#development-workflow-testing-strategy]
The setup script requirements include:
- Node.js version verification (>=20.0.0)
- pnpm installation and verification (>=9.0.0)
- Workspace package linking preferences
- Performance optimizations for air-gapped environments

### File Locations and Structure
Based on monorepo structure, files should be created at:
- Root: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, `.nvmrc`, `README.md`
- Root config: `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc`, `.editorconfig`
- Apps: `apps/web/`, `apps/api/` directories
- Packages: `packages/shared-types/`, `packages/ui-components/`, `packages/config/`
- Infrastructure: `infrastructure/docker/`, `infrastructure/scripts/`

### Workspace Scripts Configuration
[Source: architecture.md#development-workflow-testing-strategy]
Required scripts in root package.json:
- `dev`: `concurrently "pnpm -C apps/api dev" "pnpm -C apps/web dev"`
- `build`: `pnpm -r build` (recursive build across all packages)
- `test`: `pnpm -r test` (recursive testing)
- `lint`: `pnpm -r lint` (recursive linting)
- `type-check`: `pnpm -r type-check`
- `setup`: `pnpm install && pnpm build:types && pnpm db:setup`
- `docker:dev`: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`

### Air-Gapped Environment Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#development-workflow-testing-strategy]
- Registry configuration: `https://registry.npmjs.org/`
- Workspace package preferences for offline development
- Link workspace packages to avoid external dependencies where possible

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework**: Jest 30.0 with ESM support
**Test File Location**: `{package}/__tests__/` or `{package}/src/**/*.test.ts`
**Testing Standards**:
- Unit tests for utility functions and shared packages
- Integration tests for workspace package interactions
- Coverage thresholds to be configured in Jest setup
**Specific Requirements for this Story**:
- Test pnpm workspace configuration loading
- Verify package resolution across workspace boundaries
- Test script execution from root package.json
