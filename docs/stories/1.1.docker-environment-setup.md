# Story 1.1: Docker Environment Setup

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** DevOps engineer,
**I want** to configure the complete Docker Swarm environment with all service definitions,
**so that** the application can be deployed consistently across environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

1: Docker Compose configuration defines all services: app, postgres, redis, nginx, grafana, prometheus
2: PostgreSQL service includes connection pooling configuration and persistent volume mapping
3: Redis service configured with appropriate memory limits and persistence settings
4: Nginx configured as reverse proxy with SSL certificate placeholders and security headers
5: All services connected via a secure Docker network with proper isolation
6: Environment variable configuration supports development and production modes
7: Health checks defined for each service with appropriate intervals and thresholds
8: Documentation includes setup instructions and troubleshooting guide

  - [x] Create Docker Swarm deployment guide
  - [x] Add monitoring setup instructions
  - [x] Update troubleshooting guide with common Docker issues

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 0.8 (Documentation & Onboarding):

- Complete development Docker environment already exists in `config/docker-compose.dev.yml`
- Existing services: postgres, redis, api, web, nginx all properly configured for development
- Air-gapped environment constraints must be maintained
- CI/CD pipeline foundation exists and must remain functional

### Data Models

No specific data models required for this infrastructure story. [Source: Epic requirements and architecture review]

### API Specifications  

No API endpoints required for this infrastructure story. Health check endpoints already exist. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md review]

### Component Specifications

Infrastructure components from architecture:

- **Docker Swarm Configuration**: Production-ready orchestration with service definitions
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 17 with connection pooling via pgbouncer
- **Redis**: Version 8 with persistence and memory management
- **Nginx**: Version 1.27-alpine with SSL/TLS support and security headers
- **Grafana**: Version 9.x for monitoring dashboards
- **Prometheus**: Version 3.0 for metrics collection with native histograms
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

### File Locations

Based on existing project structure:

- Production Docker Compose: `docker-compose.prod.yml` (root level)
- Docker Swarm files: `infrastructure/swarm/` directory
- SSL certificates: `infrastructure/ssl/` directory  
- Monitoring configs: `infrastructure/monitoring/` directory
- Grafana dashboards: `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/dashboards/`
- Prometheus rules: `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/rules/`
[Source: Existing file structure analysis and docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

### Testing Requirements

Testing requirements from testing strategy:

- Docker Compose validation: Ensure all services start successfully
- Health check testing: Verify all service health endpoints respond correctly
- Network connectivity testing: Validate inter-service communication
- Volume persistence testing: Ensure data persists across container restarts
- SSL/TLS configuration testing: Verify certificate loading and HTTPS functionality
[Source: Reference to existing testing patterns in Epic 0 stories]

### Technical Constraints

- **Air-gap compatibility**: All Docker images must be available offline
- **Resource limits**: Production deployment must respect memory/CPU constraints
- **Security requirements**: SSL/TLS, secure headers, network isolation
- **Performance targets**: <100ms health check response times
- **Industrial environment**: Must work in restricted network environments
[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architecture-principles]

### Testing

#### Test Standards and Framework

- **Test file locations**: `infrastructure/__tests__/` directory for Docker testing
- **Testing frameworks**: Jest for configuration validation, Docker Compose for integration testing  
- **Test patterns**: Health check validation, service connectivity tests, volume persistence verification
- **Specific requirements**: All new Docker configurations must have corresponding test files validating service startup and health
