### Testing Requirements

Testing requirements from testing strategy:

- Docker Compose validation: Ensure all services start successfully
- Health check testing: Verify all service health endpoints respond correctly
- Network connectivity testing: Validate inter-service communication
- Volume persistence testing: Ensure data persists across container restarts
- SSL/TLS configuration testing: Verify certificate loading and HTTPS functionality

### Technical Constraints

- **Air-gap compatibility**: All Docker images must be available offline
- **Resource limits**: Production deployment must respect memory/CPU constraints
- **Security requirements**: SSL/TLS, secure headers, network isolation
- **Performance targets**: <100ms health check response times
- **Industrial environment**: Must work in restricted network environments
  [Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architecture-principles]

### Testing

#### Test Standards and Framework

- **Test file locations**: `infrastructure/__tests__/` directory for Docker testing
- **Testing frameworks**: Jest for configuration validation, Docker Compose for integration testing
- **Test patterns**: Health check validation, service connectivity tests, volume persistence verification
- **Specific requirements**: All new Docker configurations must have corresponding test files validating service startup and health
