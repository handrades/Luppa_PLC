## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

From **Story 4.2: Equipment CRUD API**, we have a fully implemented backend with these key endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/equipment` - Lists equipment with pagination (default 50/page, max 100)
- Equipment API includes site hierarchy data (site_name, cell_type, cell_id)
- Optimistic locking implemented with `updated_at` timestamps
- Comprehensive audit logging for all operations
- Role-based permissions: `equipment.read` required for viewing

From **Story 3.3: Industrial Data Grid Component**, we have:

- `DataGrid.tsx` component with virtual scrolling capability
- Built-in support for sorting, filtering, column resizing, reordering
- Selection support with single/multiple modes
- Performance optimized for 10,000+ rows
- Integration with Material-UI theming

### API Integration Details

**Equipment List Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/equipment`
_[Source: apps/api/src/routes/equipment.ts:78-120]_

```

### Component Architecture Details

**DataGrid Integration**:
_[Source: apps/web/src/components/common/DataDisplay/DataGrid.tsx]_

The existing DataGrid component provides:

- Virtual scrolling with `@tanstack/react-virtual`
- Column configuration with sorting, filtering, resizing
- Selection support (single/multiple modes)
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Material-UI theming integration

**Required Column Configuration**:

```typescript
const equipmentColumns: Column<EquipmentWithDetails>[] = [
  {
    id: "description",
    label: "Description",
    sortable: true,
    filterable: true,
    width: 300,
    format: (value, row) => value || `${row.name} (No PLC)`,
  },
  {
    id: "make",
    label: "Make",
    sortable: true,
    filterable: true,
    width: 150,
    format: (value) => value || "-",
  },
  {
    id: "model",
    label: "Model",
    sortable: true,
    filterable: true,
    width: 150,
    format: (value) => value || "-",
  },
  {
    id: "ip",
    label: "IP Address",
    sortable: true,
    filterable: true,
    width: 140,
    format: (value) => value || "-",
  },
  {
    id: "siteName",
    label: "Site",
    sortable: true,
    filterable: true,
    width: 120,
  },
  {
    id: "cellType",
    label: "Cell Type",
    sortable: true,
    filterable: true,
    width: 120,
  },
];
```

### State Management Architecture

**Zustand Store Structure**:
_[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md:348-386]_

Following the established pattern for state management:

```typescript
interface EquipmentState {
  // Data state
  equipment: EquipmentWithDetails[];

  // Pagination state
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    pageSize: number;
    totalItems: number;
    totalPages: number;
  };

  // Filter state
  filters: EquipmentSearchFilters;

  // UI state
  isLoading: boolean;
  isSearching: boolean;
  error: string | null;

  // Selection state
  selectedRows: Set<string>;

  // Actions
  fetchEquipment: (filters?: EquipmentSearchFilters) => Promise<void>;
  setFilters: (filters: Partial<EquipmentSearchFilters>) => void;
  setSelection: (selectedRows: Set<string>) => void;
  clearError: () => void;
}
```

### Frontend Architecture Context

**File Structure Requirements**:
_[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md:8-76]_

```text
apps/web/src/
├── pages/equipment/
│   └── EquipmentListPage.tsx       # Main page component
├── components/equipment/
│   ├── EquipmentEmptyState.tsx     # Empty state component
│   └── EquipmentActions.tsx        # Bulk action toolbar
├── services/
│   └── equipment.service.ts        # API client service
├── stores/
│   └── equipment.store.ts          # Zustand state store
├── hooks/
│   ├── useEquipment.ts            # Equipment data hook
│   └── useEquipmentSearch.ts      # Search functionality hook
└── types/
    └── equipment.ts               # TypeScript interfaces
```

**Component Template Pattern**:
_[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md:80-271]_

Follow the established component template with:

- React function components with TypeScript
- Material-UI components with consistent styling
- React Hook Form for forms (future equipment form)
- Zod schemas for validation
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Error boundary integration

### Technology Stack Requirements

**Required Dependencies**:
_[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]_

- **React**: 19.1.0 - Latest with server components
- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3 - Type-safe development
- **Material-UI**: 7.0.0 - UI component library
- **Zustand**: 5.0.2 - State management
- **@tanstack/react-virtual**: For DataGrid virtual scrolling

- **React Router**: For navigation and routing

### Performance Requirements

**Virtual Scrolling Configuration**:

- Handle 10,000+ equipment records efficiently
- Row height: 52px (consistent with Material-UI table rows)
- Overscan: 10 rows for smooth scrolling
- Pagination: Default 50 items, maximum 100 items per page
- Debounced search: 300ms delay to prevent excessive API calls

**Response Time Targets**:
_[Source: docs/prd.md:69-70]_

- Page load: <2 seconds initial, <500ms navigation
- Filter/search response: <100ms for cached results
- API response: <100ms for filtered queries

### Authentication and Authorization

**Permission Requirements**:
_[Source: apps/api/src/routes/equipment.ts:81]_

- Route requires authentication middleware
- User must have `equipment.read` permission
- JWT token passed via Authorization header
- Automatic redirect to login on 401 responses

### Error Handling Strategy

**Error Scenarios to Handle**:

- Network connectivity issues
- API timeout (configured at 30 seconds)
- Permission denied (403 Forbidden)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates **solid technical architecture** and good understanding of
React/TypeScript patterns. The code follows established project conventions and successfully
implements all 8 acceptance criteria. The developer has shown excellent use of:

- Zustand for state management with proper selectors
- React Query for API caching and data fetching
- Material-UI components with consistent theming
- TypeScript interfaces with comprehensive type safety
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Proper separation of concerns

However, several critical issues were identified that required refactoring before production readiness.

### Refactoring Performed

The following critical improvements were implemented:

- **File**: `apps/web/src/stores/__tests__/equipment.store.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed direct state mutation in tests (lines 306, 324)
  - **Why**: Direct assignment violates Zustand's immutability principle and can cause unpredictable behavior
  - **How**: Replaced with proper async actions that trigger state updates through store methods

- **File**: `apps/web/src/hooks/useEquipment.ts`
  - **Change**: Moved prefetch logic from render to useEffect (lines 115-119)
  - **Why**: Side effects during render violate React's rules and can cause infinite render loops
  - **How**: Wrapped prefetch call in useEffect with proper dependencies

- **File**: `apps/web/src/pages/equipment/EquipmentListPage.tsx`
  - **Change**: Removed console.log statements (lines 175, 181)
  - **Why**: Debug statements in production code create information leakage and appear unprofessional
  - **How**: Replaced with proper placeholder comments and early returns for invalid selections

- **File**: `apps/web/src/components/equipment/EquipmentEmptyState.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added React.memo optimization and accessibility attributes
  - **Why**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders and improves screen reader support
  - **How**: Wrapped component in React.memo and added role/aria-label attributes

- **File**: `apps/web/src/components/equipment/EquipmentActions.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added React.memo optimization and comprehensive aria-labels
  - **Why**: Performance optimization and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility
  - **How**: Added React.memo wrapper and aria-label to all interactive elements

- **File**: `apps/web/src/types/equipment.ts`
  - **Change**: Improved type safety for column definitions using generics
  - **Why**: Eliminates 'unknown' type usage and provides better IntelliSense
  - **How**: Added generic type parameter with proper ReactNode import

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ **PASS** - Follows established patterns after refactoring
- **Project Structure**: ✅ **PASS** - All files in correct locations per architecture
- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ **PASS** - Comprehensive unit tests with good coverage
- **All ACs Met**: ✅ **PASS** - All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Security Review

**No critical security vulnerabilities found.** The implementation properly:

- Uses React's built-in XSS protection
- Integrates with existing authentication middleware
- Handles input sanitization through Material-UI components
- Follows secure API client patterns

Minor improvement: Removed console.log statements that could leak internal data.

### Performance Considerations

**Excellent performance foundation** with several optimizations implemented:

- Virtual scrolling through DataGrid integration
- React Query caching with 5-minute stale time
- Debounced search with 300ms delay
- Memoized column definitions and components
- Optimized Zustand selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Load testing recommended** for 10,000+ equipment records to validate performance targets.

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed critical React hook violation in useEquipment.ts
- [x] Resolved state mutation issues in equipment store tests
- [x] Removed debug console.log statements from production code
- [x] Added React.memo optimizations to pure components
- [x] Improved TypeScript type safety with generics
- [x] Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
- [x] Optimized component re-renders with memoization
- [x] Added semantic HTML roles for screen readers
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for DataGrid column interactions
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for large dataset scenarios
- [ ] Consider extracting search logic to a dedicated service layer

### Learning Points for Developer

1. **State Management**: Always use proper actions for state updates in tests, never direct assignment
2. **React Patterns**: Side effects must be wrapped in useEffect, never called during render
3. **Production Readiness**: Remove all debug statements and console.logs before committing
4. **Performance**: Use React.memo and useMemo strategically to prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. **Accessibility**: Always include aria-labels on interactive elements for screen reader support

### Final Status

✅ **APPROVED - Ready for Done**

**Quality Score: 8.5/10** (improved from initial 7.5/10 after refactoring)

The implementation is now **production-ready** with all critical issues resolved. The code
demonstrates strong architectural understanding and follows industry best practices. The developer
has successfully created a robust, accessible, and performant equipment list UI that fully meets
the story requirements.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to Story 4.4 (Equipment Detail/Edit View) with confidence in the established patterns.
