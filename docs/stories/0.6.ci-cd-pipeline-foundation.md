## Dev Notes

From Stories 0.1-0.5, the project foundation has been established with:

- **Monorepo Structure**: pnpm workspace with apps/api and apps/web configured
- **Backend Service**: Express application with health endpoint and middleware
- **Frontend Application**: React + Vite + TypeScript with routing configured
- **Docker Environment**: Complete development environment with all services
- **Database Layer**: TypeORM with PostgreSQL, migrations, and seed data
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Jest configured in both frontend and backend applications

### Technology Stack Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions (continuously updated by GitHub)
- **Node.js Version**: From .nvmrc - Node.js v20.x LTS
- **Package Manager**: pnpm workspaces (better performance than npm/yarn)
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest 30.0 with ESM support + React Testing Library 16.1
- **Backend Testing**: Jest 30.0 + Supertest 7.0 for API testing
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.0 with Rolldown 0.15 for frontend bundling
- **TypeScript**: ^5.8.0 for both frontend and backend

### Repository Structure Context

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]

**Monorepo Structure**: pnpm workspaces with clear module boundaries

- `/apps` - Application packages (web, api)
- `/packages` - Shared libraries (ui, shared-types, config)
- `/infrastructure` - Docker configs and deployment scripts

### Previous Story Context

From Story 0.5 (Database Schema & Migration Setup):

- All 58 tests passing including database configuration, entity, and integration tests
- Health endpoint includes database connectivity monitoring
- Environment variables properly configured in .env.example
- TypeORM CLI configuration working with migration scripts

### CI/CD Workflow Requirements

**GitHub Actions Configuration**:

- Workflow triggers: push to main/master/develop, pull requests, manual dispatch
- Job parallelization for performance optimization
- Comprehensive caching strategy for dependencies and builds
- Code coverage reporting with 60% minimum threshold

**Branch Protection Requirements**:

- Main branch protection with required status checks
- PR approval requirements before merge
- Up-to-date branch requirements before merge
- Linear history enforcement for clean git history

**Dependency Management**:

- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Weekly update schedule to balance security and stability
- Package grouping for related dependency updates
- Auto-merge configuration for non-breaking updates

### File Locations and Structure

Based on project structure, files should be created at:

- GitHub workflows: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Dependabot config: `.github/dependabot.yml`
- README updates: `README.md` (root level)
- Branch protection: Configured via GitHub repository settings

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Testing Framework**: Jest 30.0 with ESM support for comprehensive testing

**Test Coverage Requirements**:

- Minimum 60% code coverage across the codebase
- Coverage reporting in CI/CD pipeline
- Fail builds if coverage drops below threshold

**Testing Standards**:

- Unit tests for all business logic components
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- Component tests for React components using React Testing Library
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows (future implementation)

**Specific Requirements for this Story**:

- CI workflow must run all existing tests from apps/api and apps/web
- Test results must be reported with coverage metrics
- Failed tests must prevent PR merging
- Test execution must be optimized with caching

### Performance Considerations

**CI/CD Performance Optimization**:

- Parallel job execution for lint, type-check, test, and build
- Aggressive caching of pnpm dependencies and build artifacts
- Incremental TypeScript compilation where possible
- Optimized Docker layer caching for future container builds

**Workflow Efficiency**:

- Fast fail strategy for early error detection
- Conditional job execution based on changed files
- Matrix strategy for Node.js version testing
- Timeout configuration to prevent stuck builds

## Testing

### Testing Framework
