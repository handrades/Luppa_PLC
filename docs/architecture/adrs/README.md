# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Industrial Inventory Multi-App Framework. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of the system.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural
decisions along with their context and consequences. They help teams understand why decisions were made and provide a historical record of the system's evolution.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: The situation that prompted the decision
- **Decision**: The chosen solution
- **Rationale**: Why this solution was chosen
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
- **Implementation Plan**: How the decision will be implemented
- **Monitoring**: Success metrics and review criteria

## Current ADRs

### Infrastructure and Backend

- [ADR-0001: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database](./0001-use-postgresql-as-primary-database.md)
  - **Status**: Accepted
  - **Summary**: PostgreSQL chosen for its industrial-grade reliability, advanced features, and air-gap compatibility

- [ADR-0002: Use TypeORM for Database Access Layer](./0002-use-typeorm-for-database-access.md)
  - **Status**: Accepted
  - **Summary**: TypeORM selected for TypeScript-first database access with strong PostgreSQL integration

### Frontend

- [ADR-0003: Use React with Material-UI for Frontend](./0003-use-react-with-material-ui-for-frontend.md)
  - **Status**: Accepted
  - **Summary**: React + Material-UI chosen for industrial-friendly UI with component reusability

### Planned ADRs

The following ADRs are planned for future documentation:

- **ADR-0004**: Use Vite for Frontend Build System
- **ADR-0005**: Use Zustand for Client State Management
- **ADR-0006**: Implement Docker Swarm for Production Deployment
- **ADR-0007**: Use pnpm Workspaces for Monorepo Management
- **ADR-0008**: Implement JWT-based Authentication
- **ADR-0009**: Use Winston for Application Logging
- **ADR-0010**: Implement Multi-Schema Pattern for Multi-App Support

## ADR Lifecycle

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Identify the Need**: When facing a significant architectural decision
2. **Research Options**: Evaluate alternatives and their trade-offs
3. **Draft ADR**: Create new ADR using the template
4. **Review Process**: Team review and discussion
5. **Decision**: Mark as Accepted and implement
6. **Monitor**: Track success metrics and review periodically

### ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]

## Status

**Status:** [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Supersedes:** [ADR reference if applicable]
**Superseded by:** [ADR reference if applicable]

## Context

[Describe the situation and problem that needs to be solved]

## Decision

[State the chosen solution clearly]

## Rationale

[Explain why this solution was chosen over alternatives]

## Implementation Plan

[How will this decision be implemented]

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- [List benefits]

### Negative Consequences

- [List drawbacks and risks]

### Risk Mitigation

- [How risks will be addressed]

## Monitoring and Success Metrics

[How success will be measured]

## Review and Evolution

[When and why this decision should be reviewed]

## References

[Links to relevant documentation]

## Related ADRs

[Links to related decisions]
```

### Updating ADRs

- **Minor Updates**: Clarifications and additional context can be added
- **Status Changes**: Update status when decisions are deprecated or superseded
- **Superseding**: Create new ADR and update references when significantly changing decisions

## Decision Categories

### Core Infrastructure

Decisions about fundamental infrastructure components (database, deployment, monitoring)

### Application Architecture

Decisions about application structure, patterns, and frameworks

### Development Process

Decisions about development tools, processes, and workflows

### Security and Compliance

Decisions about security implementation and compliance requirements

### Performance and Scalability

Decisions about performance optimization and scalability approaches

## Review Schedule

ADRs are reviewed on the following schedule:

- **After Major Milestones**: Each epic completion triggers ADR review
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Regular assessment of decision outcomes
- **Issue-Driven Reviews**: When problems arise related to architectural decisions
- **Technology Updates**: When new versions of key technologies are released

## Tools and Automation

### ADR Generation

Use the following template when creating new ADRs:

```bash
# Create new ADR
cp adr-template.md adrs/XXXX-new-decision-title.md
```

### ADR Validation

- All ADRs must follow the standard format
- Links between ADRs must be maintained
- Status updates must be consistent across related ADRs

### Integration with Development

- ADRs are referenced in code comments for architectural decisions
- Pull requests affecting architectural decisions must reference relevant ADRs
- New architectural patterns require ADR documentation

## Benefits of ADRs

1. **Historical Context**: Understanding why decisions were made
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Onboarding new team members
3. **Decision Tracking**: Monitoring outcomes and learning from decisions
4. **Consistency**: Ensuring architectural consistency across the system
5. **Risk Management**: Documenting trade-offs and mitigation strategies

## Best Practices

1. **Write Concisely**: ADRs should be clear and focused
2. **Include Alternatives**: Document why other options were rejected
3. **Quantify When Possible**: Use metrics and concrete criteria
4. **Update Status**: Keep status current as decisions evolve
5. **Link Related Decisions**: Maintain connections between related ADRs
6. **Review Regularly**: Schedule periodic reviews to assess outcomes

## Contributing

When proposing architectural changes:

1. Check existing ADRs for related decisions
2. Draft new ADR following the template
3. Include thorough research and alternatives analysis
4. Provide clear success metrics
5. Submit for team review and discussion
