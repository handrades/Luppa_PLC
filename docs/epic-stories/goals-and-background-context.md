# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deploy a functional inventory application for cataloging industrial equipment (PLCs, sensors, controllers) that
  serves process and controls engineers
- Establish a reusable multi-app framework foundation that accelerates future industrial application development
- Implement ISO-compliant audit trails and security measures to meet industrial compliance requirements
- Achieve high-performance targets (<100ms query response, <2s page loads) while scaling from 300 to 10,000+ equipment records
- Create cost-efficient solution using open-source technologies suitable for air-gapped industrial environments
- Build with open-source technologies to maintain zero licensing costs
- Design for air-gapped industrial environments with on-premise deployment
- Enable efficient equipment tracking with site hierarchy and flexible tagging system

## Background Context

The industrial equipment management landscape lacks modern, user-friendly solutions tailored for process
engineers working in on-premise, air-gapped environments. Current systems are often outdated, expensive,
or cloud-dependent, making them unsuitable for industrial operations that require reliable offline
capabilities and strict security controls.

This PRD addresses the need for a minimalist, modern CRUD web application that not only solves immediate
inventory management challenges but also establishes a strategic foundation for multiple future industrial
applications. The solution emphasizes ISO compliance, performance optimization, and framework reusability
to maximize long-term value while staying within budget constraints of open-source technologies.

Process and controls engineers currently lack a centralized system for tracking PLCs, sensors, and
controllers across multiple sites and production cells. The solution must operate within air-gapped industrial
networks while meeting strict ISO compliance requirements for audit trails and data integrity.

The strategic vision extends beyond a simple inventory system - this project establishes a multi-app framework
foundation that will accelerate development of future industrial applications. By building reusable components
for authentication, monitoring, and UI patterns, subsequent applications can be deployed rapidly while maintaining
consistency and compliance across the platform.
