# Epic 1: Framework Foundation & Core Infrastructure

This epic establishes the foundational infrastructure that all current and future applications will build upon.
It delivers the core Docker environment, authentication system, and a basic health-check endpoint to verify system
operational status, providing immediate value while setting up essential services.

## Story 1.1: Docker Environment Setup

As a DevOps engineer,
I want to configure the complete Docker Swarm environment with all service definitions,
so that the application can be deployed consistently across environments.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Docker Compose configuration defines all services: app, postgres, redis, nginx, grafana, prometheus
2: PostgreSQL service includes connection pooling configuration and persistent volume mapping
3: Redis service configured with appropriate memory limits and persistence settings
4: Nginx configured as reverse proxy with SSL certificate placeholders and security headers
5: All services connected via a secure Docker network with proper isolation
6: Environment variable configuration supports development and production modes
7: Health checks defined for each service with appropriate intervals and thresholds
8: Documentation includes setup instructions and troubleshooting guide

## Story 1.2: Database Schema Foundation

As a developer,
I want to create the core database schema with user management tables,
so that authentication and authorization can be implemented.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: PostgreSQL database created with proper encoding and locale settings
2: Core tables created: users, roles, permissions, user_roles with proper constraints
3: UUID primary keys implemented with gen_random_uuid() function
4: Audit trigger functions created for automatic timestamp updates
5: Initial roles created: admin, engineer, viewer with appropriate permissions
6: TypeORM entities match database schema with proper decorators
7: Database migrations created and tested for rollback capability
8: Connection pooling configured with appropriate limits

## Story 1.3: JWT Authentication Implementation

As a system user,
I want to authenticate using email and password to receive a JWT token,
so that I can access protected resources securely.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: POST /auth/login endpoint accepts email/password and returns JWT token
2: Passwords hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
3: JWT tokens include user ID, roles, and 24-hour expiration
4: POST /auth/refresh endpoint allows token refresh before expiration
5: Authentication middleware validates tokens and populates req.user
6: Invalid credentials return appropriate error messages without revealing user existence
7: Rate limiting applied to prevent brute force attacks (5 attempts per minute)
8: Session tracking implemented in Redis with token blacklist capability

## Story 1.4: Basic Health Check & System Info

As a system administrator,
I want to verify the application and all services are operational,
so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: GET /health endpoint returns 200 OK with service status information
2: Health check verifies database connectivity and returns connection pool stats
3: Redis connectivity verified with memory usage information
4: Response includes version information and deployment timestamp
5: Endpoint accessible without authentication for monitoring tools
6: Response time consistently under 100ms
7: Structured JSON response format for parsing by monitoring systems
8: Error states return appropriate HTTP status codes with details
