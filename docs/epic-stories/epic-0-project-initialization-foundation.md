# Epic 0: Project Initialization & Foundation

This epic establishes the complete project structure, development environment, and foundational code required
before any feature development can begin. It transforms the project from documentation-only to an executable
codebase with working health checks and basic UI routing.

3: Configure root package.json with workspace scripts: dev, build, test, lint
4: Set up TypeScript with base tsconfig.json and package-specific configurations
5: Create comprehensive .gitignore covering node_modules, dist, .env, and IDE files
6: Add .nvmrc specifying Node.js v20.x LTS version
7: Create README.md with project overview and quick start instructions
8: Configure ESLint and Prettier with workspace-wide rules and .editorconfig

## Story 0.2: Backend Application Scaffolding

As a backend developer,
I want a working Express application with TypeScript and basic middleware,
so that I can start implementing API endpoints.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Initialize Express + TypeScript application in /apps/api with proper structure
2: Implement GET /health endpoint returning status, timestamp, version, environment
3: Configure essential middleware: helmet, cors, compression, express.json, request-id
4: Set up centralized error handling with consistent error response format
5: Configure Winston logger with console and file transports with rotation
6: Create nodemon.json for development hot-reload configuration
7: Add npm scripts: dev (tsx), build (tsc), start (node), test (jest)
8: Implement graceful shutdown handling and port configuration from environment

## Story 0.3: Frontend Application Scaffolding

As a frontend developer,
I want a working React application with routing and Material-UI configured,
so that I can start building user interfaces.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project in /apps/web
2: Install and configure Material-UI v7 with custom industrial theme
3: Set up React Router with routes: /login, / (dashboard), /equipment, 404
4: Create base layout components: AppLayout, PublicLayout, LoadingSpinner, ErrorBoundary
5: Configure Axios API client with interceptors and environment-based URL
6: Create .env.example with all required frontend environment variables
7: Configure Vite build optimization with code splitting and compression
8: Set up development proxy to backend API for local development

## Story 0.4: Docker Development Environment

As a developer,
I want a complete Docker Compose setup for local development,
so that I can run all services with a single command.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Create docker-compose.dev.yml with services: api, web, postgres, redis, nginx
2: Configure PostgreSQL 17 with initialization scripts and persistent volumes
3: Configure Redis 8 with memory limits and AOF persistence
4: Create Nginx reverse proxy configuration routing /api/\* and /\* appropriately
5: Set up Docker networking with custom network for service discovery
6: Create comprehensive .env.example with all service configuration variables
7: Create Makefile with commands: up, down, logs, shell-api, reset-db
8: Add health checks for all services with appropriate intervals

## Story 0.5: Database Schema & Migration Setup

As a developer,
I want database migrations and initial schema configured,
so that I can manage database changes systematically.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Install and configure TypeORM with PostgreSQL driver and connection pooling
2: Create TypeORM configuration with environment-based settings
3: Create initial migration with users, roles tables and update_timestamp trigger
4: Implement migration scripts: generate, run, revert in package.json
5: Create seed data script with test roles and sample users for development
6: Configure TypeORM entities with base entity class for common fields
7: Set up connection pooling with min 2, max 10 connections
8: Create database backup script for development environment

## Story 0.6: CI/CD Pipeline Foundation

As a DevOps engineer,
I want automated testing and building via GitHub Actions,
so that code quality is maintained and deployments are reliable.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Create .github/workflows/ci.yml with lint, type-check, test, and build jobs
2: Configure job matrix for Node.js versions with parallel execution
3: Set up caching for pnpm dependencies and build artifacts
4: Create PR checks requiring all CI jobs to pass and 60% code coverage
5: Configure Dependabot for weekly dependency updates
6: Create release workflow triggered on tag push
7: Add status badges to README for build, coverage, and release
8: Configure branch protection rules for main branch

## Story 0.7: Development Tooling & Scripts

As a developer,
I want comprehensive development tools and scripts configured,
so that I can maintain code quality and productivity.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Configure Git hooks with Husky for pre-commit, commit-msg, and pre-push
2: Set up lint-staged for incremental linting on staged files
3: Configure Jest testing framework with coverage thresholds
4: Create utility scripts: setup.sh, reset-db.sh, generate-types.sh
5: Configure VS Code workspace settings and recommended extensions
6: Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
7: Set up conventional commits with commitizen
8: Add Plop.js templates for component and API endpoint generation

## Story 0.8: Documentation & Onboarding

As a new developer,
I want comprehensive documentation and quick start guides,
so that I can begin contributing within 30 minutes.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Create SETUP.md with prerequisites, quick start, and detailed instructions
2: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with code style, branching, and PR guidelines
3: Create ARCHITECTURE.md with system overview and key decisions
