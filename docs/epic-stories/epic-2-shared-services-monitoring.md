# Epic 2: Shared Services & Monitoring

This epic implements the critical shared services that provide cross-cutting functionality for all applications.
It includes comprehensive audit logging for ISO compliance, user management APIs, monitoring dashboards, and
core middleware that ensure consistent behavior across the platform.

## Story 2.1: Audit Logging Service
As a compliance officer,
I want all data modifications automatically logged with full context,
so that we maintain ISO compliance and can track all system changes.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: audit_logs table created with proper foreign keys and cascading deletes
2: Audit middleware automatically captures user, timestamp, action, and changes for all mutations
3: JSON diff stored for before/after states of modified records
4: Audit records immutable once created (no updates or deletes allowed)
5: GET /api/audit-logs endpoint with pagination and filtering by user, date range, and action
6: Audit logs retained indefinitely with archival strategy documented
7: Performance impact less than 10ms per request
8: Audit entries include IP address and user agent information

## Story 2.2: User Management API
As an administrator,
I want to manage user accounts through a complete API,
so that I can onboard engineers and control system access.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: POST /api/users endpoint creates new users with email validation
2: GET /api/users lists all users with pagination and role filtering
3: PUT /api/users/:id updates user details with audit logging
4: DELETE /api/users/:id soft deletes users, preserving audit history
5: POST /api/users/:id/roles assigns roles with permission validation
6: Password reset flow implemented with secure token generation
7: Email notifications sent for account creation and password changes
8: API returns consistent error formats with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Story 2.3: Monitoring Dashboard Setup
As a system administrator,
I want to view real-time system metrics and performance data,
so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Prometheus configured to scrape application metrics every 30 seconds
2: Application exposes /metrics endpoint with custom business metrics
3: Grafana dashboards created for system resources, API performance, and error rates
4: Dashboard shows request rates, response times, and error counts by endpoint
5: Database connection pool metrics visible with active/idle connection counts
6: Redis memory usage and hit/miss ratios displayed
7: Alerts configured for high error rates and resource exhaustion
8: Dashboards accessible via Nginx reverse proxy at /monitoring

## Story 2.4: Core Middleware Implementation
As a developer,
I want consistent request handling across all endpoints,
so that the application behaves predictably and securely.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Request ID middleware generates unique ID for request tracing
2: Error handling middleware catches all errors and returns consistent format
3: Request validation middleware uses Joi schemas with detailed error messages
4: CORS middleware configured for cross-origin requests in development
5: Compression middleware reduces response sizes for JSON and static assets
6: Request logging middleware captures method, path, status, and duration
7: Security headers middleware implements OWASP recommendations
8: All middleware properly ordered in Express application setup
