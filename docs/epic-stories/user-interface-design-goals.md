# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The interface should prioritize **industrial efficiency and data clarity** with a clean, functional design
that supports rapid information access during plant visits and troubleshooting scenarios. The UX should feel
familiar to technical users while being intuitive enough for occasional users. Focus on **information
density** and **task completion speed** over aesthetic flourishes.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Table-centric views** with advanced filtering and sorting for equipment listings
- **Modal dialogs** for CRUD operations to maintain context
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users who need rapid data entry
- **Bulk selection** capabilities for mass operations (import/export/tagging)
- **Search-first approach** with global search and scoped filtering
- **Filter-First Navigation**: Advanced filtering capabilities are prominently accessible, allowing engineers to
  quickly narrow down equipment by site, type, or attributes
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed contextually to avoid overwhelming new users while
  providing power user capabilities
- **Offline-First Design**: Clear visual indicators for sync status and local changes pending upload

## Core Screens and Views
- **Equipment Listing Screen** - Primary data grid with advanced filtering
- **Equipment Detail/Edit Screen** - Comprehensive CRUD form with validation
- **Dashboard Screen** - Site summaries, KPIs, and quick access panels
- **Import/Export Screen** - Bulk operations interface with progress indicators
- **User Management Screen** - RBAC administration for administrators
- **Audit Log Screen** - Compliance reporting and activity tracking
- **Login Screen** - Simple authentication with role indication
- **Site Hierarchy Navigator** - Visual tree view of site organization

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting WCAG AA standards ensures usability in industrial environments with varying lighting conditions and
supports users who may have visual or motor accessibility needs.

## Branding
**Industrial/Technical aesthetic** with:
- Clean, high-contrast color scheme suitable for industrial monitors
- Sans-serif typography optimized for readability
- Consistent iconography using industrial symbols where appropriate
- Color coding for equipment status/types while maintaining accessibility
- Minimal animations to avoid distraction in critical work environments

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
**Web Responsive** supporting:
- Desktop workstations (primary use case for office work)
- Tablet devices for plant floor access
- Rugged industrial tablets with touch-optimized interactions
- Support for older browsers common in industrial environments
