This epic completes the inventory application by adding power-user features that enable efficient management of
large equipment datasets. It delivers bulk operations, advanced filtering, comprehensive search, and analytics
dashboards that transform the basic CRUD system into a complete industrial inventory solution.

## Story 5.1: Advanced Filtering System

4: Tag-based filtering with AND/OR logic options
5: Filter combinations can be saved as presets with names
6: Clear all filters button resets to default view
7: Active filters displayed as removable chips
8: URL updates to reflect current filters for shareable links

## Story 5.2: Full-Text Search Implementation
As an engineer,
I want to search across all equipment fields with a single query,
so that I can find equipment without knowing exact field values.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: PostgreSQL full-text search configured with proper indexes
2: Search includes description, make, model, tags, and site fields
3: Search supports partial matches and fuzzy matching
4: Results highlight matching terms in displayed data
5: Search performance under 100ms for 10,000 records
6: Recent searches saved and suggested in dropdown
7: Search syntax guide accessible via help icon
8: API endpoint GET /api/equipment/search with pagination

## Story 5.3: Bulk Import/Export Operations
As a data administrator,
I want to import and export equipment data in bulk,
so that I can efficiently manage large datasets and migrations.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: CSV template downloadable with all required fields
2: Drag-and-drop CSV upload with progress indicator
3: Import preview shows first 10 rows with validation status
4: Validation errors displayed per row with clear messages
5: Duplicate detection based on IP address with merge options
6: Export includes filters to download specific subsets
7: Background processing for files over 1000 rows
8: Import history log with rollback capability

## Story 5.4: Equipment Analytics Dashboard
As a manager,
I want to view equipment distribution and statistics,
so that I can make informed decisions about inventory management.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Dashboard displays total equipment count with trend indicator
2: Pie charts show distribution by site, make, and equipment type
3: Bar chart displays top 10 models by count
4: Site hierarchy visualization with equipment counts per cell
5: Recently added/modified equipment list with user info
6: Charts are interactive with drill-down capability
7: Dashboard refreshes every 5 minutes automatically
8: Export dashboard as PDF report with timestamp
