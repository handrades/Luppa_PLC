## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS**: None identified

**HIGH Priority:**

- User journey flows need detailed mapping for complex workflows (equipment import/export)
- Data model relationships between equipment, sites, and audit logs need clarification
- Performance benchmarking approach for 10,000+ records needs validation methodology

**MEDIUM Priority:**

- Edge case handling for CSV import validation could be expanded
- Error recovery workflows for failed operations need documentation
- Integration testing approach for air-gapped environments needs detail

**LOW Priority:**

- Visual design guidelines could be more specific
- Future enhancement roadmap could include more technical debt considerations

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Evaluation**: **Just Right**

- Epic 1-2 provide solid MVP foundation with immediate user value
- Epic 3-5 provide clear progression without feature bloat
- Framework approach is appropriate for stated multi-app vision
- Timeline expectations (9-13 weeks) align well with epic complexity

**Strengths:**

- Clear separation between core functionality (Epic 1-2) and enhancements (Epic 3-5)
- Each epic delivers deployable value
- Story sizing appears appropriate for solo developer execution

**Appropriately Scoped Features**:

- Core CRUD operations for equipment management
- Authentication and authorization framework
- Audit logging for ISO compliance
- Basic monitoring and health checks
- Essential UI components and data grid

**Potential Scope Reductions** (if timeline pressure):

- Analytics dashboard (Story 5.4) could be deferred
- Advanced filtering presets (Story 5.1) could be simplified
- Dark mode support could be post-MVP

## Technical Readiness

**Assessment**: **Nearly Ready**

- Technical constraints are clearly articulated
- Technology stack choices are well-justified
- Architecture approach balances simplicity with extensibility
- Performance requirements are aggressive but achievable with proper implementation

**Areas for Architect Investigation:**

- Database indexing strategy for sub-100ms query performance with 10K+ records
- Docker Swarm vs. Docker Compose trade-offs for industrial deployment
- Redis caching patterns for equipment data and session management
- PostgreSQL connection pooling optimal settings
- Nginx rate limiting implementation
- Module boundary definition within monolith

## Recommendations

1. **Before Architecture Phase:**
   - Create detailed user journey maps for equipment import/export workflows
   - Define specific data model relationships and foreign key constraints
   - Establish performance testing methodology for NFR validation

2. **Architecture Considerations:**
   - Focus on database performance optimization strategies
   - Design caching architecture for equipment queries
   - Plan for offline capability implementation in air-gapped environments

3. **Story Refinement:**
   - Add more specific acceptance criteria for complex stories (CSV import, audit logging)
   - Consider breaking down larger stories if they exceed 4-hour implementation estimates

## Final Decision

**NEARLY READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD provides excellent foundation with clear requirements,
well-structured epics, and appropriate technical guidance. Minor refinements to user journey details and data
modeling would strengthen the handoff to the architecture phase.
