# Industrial Inventory Multi-App Framework Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Deploy a functional Inventory application for industrial equipment cataloging that serves process and
  controls engineers
- Establish a reusable multi-app framework foundation that accelerates future industrial application
  development
- Implement ISO-compliant audit trails and security measures to meet industrial compliance requirements
- Achieve high-performance targets (<100ms query response, <2s page loads) while scaling from 300 to
  10,000+ equipment records
- Create cost-efficient solution using open-source technologies suitable for air-gapped industrial
  environments

### Background Context
The industrial equipment management landscape lacks modern, user-friendly solutions tailored for process
engineers working in on-premise, air-gapped environments. Current systems are often outdated, expensive,
or cloud-dependent, making them unsuitable for industrial operations that require reliable offline
capabilities and strict security controls.

This PRD addresses the need for a minimalist, modern CRUD web application that not only solves immediate
inventory management challenges but also establishes a strategic foundation for multiple future industrial
applications. The solution emphasizes ISO compliance, performance optimization, and framework reusability
to maximize long-term value while staying within budget constraints of open-source technologies.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The interface should prioritize **industrial efficiency and data clarity** with a clean, functional design
that supports rapid information access during plant visits and troubleshooting scenarios. The UX should feel
familiar to technical users while being intuitive enough for occasional users. Focus on **information
density** and **task completion speed** over aesthetic flourishes.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Table-centric views** with advanced filtering and sorting for equipment listings
- **Modal dialogs** for CRUD operations to maintain context
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users who need rapid data entry
- **Bulk selection** capabilities for mass operations (import/export/tagging)
- **Search-first approach** with global search and scoped filtering

### Core Screens and Views
- **Equipment Listing Screen** - Primary data grid with advanced filtering
- **Equipment Detail/Edit Screen** - Comprehensive CRUD form with validation
- **Dashboard Screen** - Site summaries, KPIs, and quick access panels
- **Import/Export Screen** - Bulk operations interface with progress indicators
- **User Management Screen** - RBAC administration for administrators
- **Audit Log Screen** - Compliance reporting and activity tracking
- **Login Screen** - Simple authentication with role indication

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting WCAG AA standards ensures usability in industrial environments with varying lighting conditions and
supports users who may have visual or motor accessibility needs.

### Branding
**Industrial/Technical aesthetic** with:
- Clean, high-contrast color scheme suitable for industrial monitors
- Sans-serif typography optimized for readability
- Consistent iconography using industrial symbols where appropriate
- Color coding for equipment status/types while maintaining accessibility
- Minimal animations to avoid distraction in critical work environments

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
**Web Responsive** supporting:
- Desktop workstations (primary use case for office work)
- Tablet devices for plant floor access
- Rugged industrial tablets with touch-optimized interactions
- Support for older browsers common in industrial environments

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
**Monorepo** approach using a single repository containing:
- Shared framework components and libraries
- Backend API services
- Frontend React applications
- Infrastructure configuration (Docker, CI/CD)
- Documentation and tooling

This supports the multi-app framework vision while maintaining code sharing and consistent development
workflows.

### Service Architecture
**Layered Monolith with Framework Foundation** - A structured monolithic application with clear separation
of concerns:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Docker Swarm orchestration, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx
- **Framework Layer**: Shared authentication, audit logging, user management, notification services
- **Application Layer**: Inventory application with dedicated schemas and business logic
- **Frontend Layer**: React framework with reusable component library

This approach balances development simplicity for a solo developer while providing the foundation for future
application expansion.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing** strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for backend logic and React Testing Library for components
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with supertest, database integration tests
- **Manual Testing Convenience**: Postman collections for API testing and development
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline integration for continuous validation

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL primary with Redis for session management and caching
- **Authentication**: Local JWT-based auth with bcrypt password hashing (no external providers)
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with consistent error handling and response formats
- **Frontend Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite for development speed and type safety
- **UI Component Library**: Material-UI with industrial theme customization
- **Container Strategy**: Docker Swarm for on-premise orchestration and service management
- **Monitoring Stack**: Grafana + Prometheus + Winston logging for observability
- **Air-Gap Compatibility**: All dependencies must support offline installation and updates
- **Performance Optimization**: Database indexing strategy, Redis caching, and query optimization
- **Security Framework**: RBAC implementation, input validation with Joi, SQL injection prevention
