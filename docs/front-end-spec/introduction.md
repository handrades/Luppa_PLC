# Introduction

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Field Engineer:** Technical professional who needs quick equipment lookup during plant visits, often using
tablets in industrial environments with varying lighting conditions and while wearing safety equipment.

**Controls Engineer:** Power user managing large equipment datasets, requiring advanced filtering and bulk
operations for efficient inventory management across multiple sites and production cells.

**Plant Manager:** Oversight role needing dashboards, reports, and audit trails for compliance, with focus
on equipment distribution, status monitoring, and operational insights.

### Usability Goals

- **Ease of learning:** New engineers can complete core equipment tasks within 15 minutes
- **Efficiency of use:** Frequent tasks completable in <3 clicks with <100ms response times
- **Industrial durability:** Interface works reliably in harsh lighting and with work gloves
- **Error prevention:** Clear validation and confirmation for critical operations (delete, bulk changes)
- **Memorability:** Infrequent users can return without relearning core workflows

### Design Principles

1. **Industrial Efficiency Over Aesthetics** - Function and speed trump visual flair, prioritizing data clarity and task completion
2. **Information Density** - Show maximum relevant data without overwhelming, optimized for technical users who need comprehensive information
3. **Touch-Friendly Precision** - Works reliably on tablets with industrial gloves, maintaining precision for detailed data entry
4. **Consistent Mental Models** - Use familiar patterns across all framework apps to reduce learning curve for future applications
5. **Fail-Safe Operations** - Clear confirmations for destructive actions with comprehensive audit trails for compliance
