# Component Library / Design System

## Design System Approach

**React Component Library with Material-UI Industrial Theme**

- Base: Material-UI components customized for industrial contexts
- Enhancement: GSAP animations for professional micro-interactions  
- Framework: Storybook for component development and documentation
- Distribution: NPM package for easy sharing across framework apps

## Core Components

### DataGrid (Industrial Data Table)

**Purpose:** High-performance equipment listing with industrial-grade functionality

**Variants:**

- Standard Grid (desktop): Full feature set with 8+ columns, advanced filtering
- Compact Grid (tablet): Condensed view with key fields only, touch optimization
- Card View (mobile): Stacked cards for touch interaction, essential information

**States:**

- Loading (skeleton animation with GSAP shimmer effect)
- Empty (helpful guidance state with clear next actions)
- Error (clear recovery options with retry mechanisms)
- Selection (bulk operation mode with multi-select capabilities)

**Usage Guidelines:**

- Use for any tabular equipment data >50 records
- Always include virtual scrolling for performance with large datasets
- Provide keyboard navigation for power users and accessibility

### EquipmentForm (Industrial Form System)

**Purpose:** Consistent form experience across all equipment data entry

**Variants:**

- Create Mode: Empty form with smart defaults and field suggestions
- Edit Mode: Pre-populated with change tracking and audit logging
- View Mode: Read-only with clear edit trigger and permission awareness

**States:**

- Pristine (no changes made, clean initial state)
- Dirty (unsaved changes with auto-save indicator and visual feedback)
- Validating (real-time validation feedback with GSAP animations)
- Saving (progress indication with smooth transitions)
- Error (field-level error messaging with clear recovery guidance)

**Usage Guidelines:**

- Always include auto-save with visual confirmation every 30 seconds
- Use touch-friendly targets (44px minimum) for industrial tablet usage
- Provide clear required field indicators and validation feedback

### StatusCard (Dashboard Widget)

**Purpose:** Consistent information display for dashboard and summary views

**Variants:**

- Metric Card: Single number with trend indicator and historical context
- Chart Card: Embedded visualization with touch/click interactions
- Action Card: Quick actions with prominent call-to-action buttons

**States:**

- Loading (animated placeholder with professional skeleton design)
- Loaded (data with GSAP entrance animation and smooth transitions)
- Error (retry mechanism with clear error messaging)
- Interactive (hover/touch feedback with subtle GSAP effects)

**Usage Guidelines:**

- Use GSAP for smooth data transitions and professional feel
- Keep information hierarchy clear with proper typography scale
- Ensure touch targets meet industrial glove requirements (44px+)

### NavigationSidebar (Framework Navigation)

**Purpose:** Consistent navigation across all framework applications

**Variants:**

- Expanded: Full labels and icons for desktop efficiency
- Collapsed: Icons only for space efficiency with tooltips
- Mobile: Drawer overlay for small screens with touch optimization

**States:**

- Active Section (visual emphasis on current area with clear highlighting)
- Hover/Focus (GSAP micro-interactions with subtle feedback)
- Loading (navigation state feedback during route transitions)

**Usage Guidelines:**

- Maintain consistency across all framework apps for user familiarity
- Use breadcrumbs for deep navigation and clear location context
- Provide full keyboard navigation support for accessibility
