# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** Initial application load <2 seconds, subsequent navigation <500ms
- **Interaction Response:** User interactions (clicks, typing) respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all GSAP animations, even with large datasets
- **Data Operations:** Equipment search/filtering <100ms for datasets up to 10,000 records
- **Memory Usage:** Total application memory footprint <500MB (desktop), <200MB (mobile) for optimal browser stability

## Design Strategies

**Performance-First Design Decisions:**

1. **Virtual Scrolling Architecture:** Only render visible rows + buffer for large datasets, GSAP animations only on visible elements

2. **Progressive Data Loading:** Essential equipment data on initial load, detailed information on-demand, background preloading of likely-needed data

3. **Intelligent Caching Strategy:** Component-level caching with React.memo, API response caching, lazy loading for images, search result caching

4. **Optimized Animation Performance:** GPU acceleration with force3D, batch DOM reads/writes, cleanup of animations and event listeners

5. **Bundle Optimization:** Route-based code splitting, tree shaking unused components, dynamic imports for GSAP plugins, asset optimization

6. **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of GSAP animations, efficient data structures, minimal object creation in render loops, optimized image disposal
