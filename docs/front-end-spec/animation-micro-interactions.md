# Animation & Micro-interactions

## Motion Principles

**Industrial Motion Design Philosophy:**

1. **Functional First:** Every animation serves a clear purpose (feedback, transition, or guidance)
2. **Subtle & Professional:** Enhance usability without drawing attention to the animation itself
3. **Performance Conscious:** Smooth 60fps animations that don't impact data processing
4. **Consistent Timing:** Standardized durations and easing for predictable user experience
5. **Accessible Motion:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for users sensitive to animation

## Key Animations

**Core Equipment Management Animations:**

- **Equipment Row Hover:** Subtle background color transition with slight elevation (Duration: 150ms, Easing: power2.out)
- **Form Field Focus:** Border color change with gentle glow effect (Duration: 200ms, Easing: power2.out)
- **Auto-save Confirmation:** Success checkmark with gentle scale animation (Duration: 400ms, Easing: back.out)
- **Data Loading:** Professional skeleton animation with shimmer effect (Duration: 1.5s loop, Easing: linear)
- **Filter Panel Slide:** Smooth slide-in/out with backdrop fade (Duration: 300ms, Easing: power2.inOut)
- **Status Indicator Pulse:** Subtle breathing animation for online/offline states (Duration: 2s loop, Easing: sine.inOut)
- **Search Results Appearance:** Staggered fade-in of results with slight upward motion (Duration: 250ms, Easing: power2.out)
- **Theme Toggle:** Smooth color transitions across entire interface (Duration: 400ms, Easing: power2.inOut)
- **Bulk Selection:** Checkbox states with satisfying check animation (Duration: 200ms, Easing: back.out)
- **Error State:** Gentle shake animation for invalid input feedback (Duration: 300ms, Easing: elastic.out)
- **Modal Open/Close:** Scale and fade transition with backdrop blur (Duration: 300ms, Easing: power2.out)
- **Chart Data Updates:** Smooth interpolation between data states (Duration: 500ms, Easing: power2.inOut)
