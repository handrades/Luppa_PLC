- **Monitoring Stack**: Grafana/Prometheus dashboards

#### Layer 2: Data & Security Foundation
- **Shared Tables**: users, roles, permissions, audit_logs, notifications
- **App-Specific Schemas**: inventory, maintenance_schedule (future apps)
- **Configuration Tables**: app_settings, feature_flags, api_keys
- **Security Framework**: JWT authentication, RBAC, API rate limiting

#### Layer 3: Shared Business Logic
- **User Management API**: Registration, profiles, password management
- **Notification Service**: Email templates, in-app alerts
- **File Upload Service**: Secure handling with validation
- **Audit Service**: Automatic activity logging across apps
- **Report Engine**: PDF generation, data export functionality

#### Layer 4: Frontend Framework
- **Component Library**: Industrial-themed Material-UI customization
- **Layout System**: Headers, sidebars, responsive grid
- **Data Grid**: Virtual scrolling, filtering, sorting, pagination
- **Dashboard Widgets**: Charts, KPIs, notification panels
